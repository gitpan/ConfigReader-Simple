   - Bumped up the version number because it's nearly mature
   - Now you can declare all, some or no keys and it will only die if a
     declared key is not found in the config file. 
     (Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>)

New in 0.5
   - Changed module name to ConfigReader::Simple to match up with
     other modules in CPAN better.

New in 0.4
   - Quote-delimiters now have to be matched, ie not 'foo" etc.

New in 0.3
   - Doesn't get confused by trailing whitespace

   - Copes with quote-delimited strings as long as they're all on the
   same line.
