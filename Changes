1.27 - Wed Aug 20 12:33:43 2008

	value instead of checking for the directive name. This

1.23 - Mon Apr 10 09:30:54 2006

	* If you want to name your configuration directives with characters
	outside of \w, you should upgrade to this version
	* If your teammates are using config directives with characters
	outside of \w, they're going to make you upgrade. :)

	* added new_multiple() to parse multiple files into the same
	object.
	
0.91
	* you don't need to call parse() since new() does it for you

		Alan W. Jurgensen <jurgensen@berbee.com>
	* the module is now maintained by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

0.9
   * Bumped up the version number because it's nearly mature
   * Now you can declare all, some or no keys and it will only die if a
     declared key is not found in the config file. 
     (Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>)

0.5
   * Changed module name to ConfigReader::Simple to match up with
     other modules in CPAN better.

0.4
   * Quote*delimiters now have to be matched, ie not 'foo" etc.

0.3
   * Doesn't get confused by trailing whitespace

   same line.
