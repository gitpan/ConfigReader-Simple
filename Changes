# $Id: Changes,v 1.11 2007/01/10 04:02:29 comdog Exp $

1.24 - Tue Jan  9 22:02:27 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.23 - Mon Apr 10 09:30:54 2006
	* Changed configuration directive parsing to accept [^\s=]+ instead of
	just \w+ 
	* If you want to name your configuration directives with characters
	outside of \w, you should upgrade to this version
	* If your teammates are using config directives with characters
	outside of \w, they're going to make you upgrade. :)  

1.21 - Wed Aug 24 18:37:34 2005
	* Fixed string parsing bug which messed up on continuation lines
	* cloning an object now makes a deep copy, fixing another bug

1.18 - Tue Feb 10 20:46:05 2004
* Adam Trickett added support for continuation lines
* I added docs for config file formats

1.17 - Sun Nov 30 11:12:50 2003
	+ some fix ups for the POD docs
	+ fixed a problem in t/pod.t so the test finds the files
	+ if you already have this installed, you don't need this update

New in 1.20
	- Removed all module dependencies except Test::More

New in 1.15
	- new_multiple can keep going if it cannot read a file
	- added $Die, $Warn, $ERROR, %Error variables for settings
	- things that should croak do

New in 1.14
	- cleaned up Makefile.PL
	- added prereq test

New in 1.12
	_ added add_config_file() to pull in more configuration directives

New in 1.11
	- added new_multiple() to parse multiple files into the same
	object.
	
New in 0.91
	- you don't need to call parse() since new() does it for you
	- you can use the NAME=VALUE format in config files thanks to
		Alan W. Jurgensen <jurgensen@berbee.com>
	- the module is now maintained by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

New in 0.9
   - Bumped up the version number because it's nearly mature
   - Now you can declare all, some or no keys and it will only die if a
     declared key is not found in the config file. 
     (Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>)

New in 0.5
   - Changed module name to ConfigReader::Simple to match up with
     other modules in CPAN better.

New in 0.4
   - Quote-delimiters now have to be matched, ie not 'foo" etc.

New in 0.3
   - Doesn't get confused by trailing whitespace

   - Copes with quote-delimited strings as long as they're all on the
   same line.
