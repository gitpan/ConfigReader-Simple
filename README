ConfigReader::Simple


Designed to be simpler than the ConfigReader module, firstly it seemed
like overkill for what I wanted, and secondly I couldn't figure it out
:)



INSTALLING
==========

After unzipping and untarring the distribution directory, you install
the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


OTHER STUFF
===========


At this early stage (ie:  I coded it last night) it's still got
some major limitations/bugs - see the pod docs for details.

And the 'make test' stuff is completely rudimentary.  More will
follow.


Contacting me:  gossamer@tertius.net.au is best.
